/**
 ðŸ’¾ Disk v 0.0.1
 Easily work with the file system without worrying about any of its intricacies!
 
 - Store Codable structs, UIImage, [UIImage], Data, [Data] to Apple recommended locations on the user's disk
 - Retrieve an object from disk as the type you specify, without having to worry about conversion or casting
 - Remove specific objects from disk, clear entire directories if you need to, or check if an object exists on disk
 
 Data persistence has never been easier in Swift, and I hope Disk makes it evermore delightful!
