/**
 ðŸ’¾ Disk v0.1.0
 Easily work with the file system without worrying about any of its intricacies!
 
 - Store Codable structs, UIImage, [UIImage], Data, [Data] to Apple recommended locations on the user's disk, without having to worry about serialization.
 - Retrieve an object from disk as the type you specify, without having to worry about deserialization.
 - Remove specific objects from disk, clear entire directories if you need to, check if an object exists on disk, and much more!
 
 Data persistence has never been easier in Swift, and I hope Disk makes it evermore delightful!
